# Variables
A variable is a box where you can store data, functions, objects
or arrays.

```javascript
var myVariable = 1;

var myFunction = function() {
	//do stuff here
}
```

#Arrays
An array is a list of data. It is possible to make an array
of strings, numbers or even objects. You cab access data in
an array by calling out the position of the data within the array.

```javascript
var myArray = [
	"picard",
	"kirk",
	"janeway"
];

```

#Objects
An object is a kind of list. The difference is
that every entery in the list must have a key word. This way 
you can access the data by the keyword. Each line entery within
an object is called an attribute. 

```javascript
var myObject = {
	name: "picard",
	alias: "locutus of borg",
	rank: "captain"
}  
```
